## BigO

Big O notation is an instrument used to calculate the complexity of the algorithm.
It could be used to measure time and space complexity.

**Time complexity** allows formalizing the growth of the algorithm's runtime as the input growth. 

**Space complexity** refers to space required by the algorithm, not including space taken by the inputs.
