## BigO

Big O notation is an instrument used to calculate the complexity of the algorithm.
It could be used to measure time and space complexity.

**Time complexity** allows formalizing the growth of the algorithm's runtime as the input growth. 

**Space complexity** refers to space required by the algorithm, not including space taken by the inputs.
    * Booleans, numbers, undefined, null = constant space O(1)
    * Strings - O(n) where n is the length of the string
    * Referance types are also O(n) where n is the length for arrays and number of keys for objects
