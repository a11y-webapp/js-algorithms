<h2>Design Patterns</h2>

<h3>SOLID</h3>

<div>SOLID is acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.</div>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Single responsibility principle.</strong> It states that every module, class, or function should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.</li>
    <li><strong>Openâ€“closed principle.</strong> It states "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification"; that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.</li> 
    <li><strong>Liskov substitution principle.</strong> Stating that, in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S (i.e. an object of type T may be substituted with any object of a subtype S) without altering any of the desirable properties of the program (correctness, task performed, etc.). </li>
    <li><strong>Interface segregation principle.</strong> "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface." No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them. Such shrunken interfaces are also called role interfaces.</li>
    <li><strong>Dependency inversion principle</strong> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.</li>
</ul>
