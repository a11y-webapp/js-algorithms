## Bubble Sort

The **bubble sorting algorithm** is based on bubbling up largest value to the top. Looping through the compare the current value (i) with the next one (i+1), if it's bigger then swap them. Then compare swaped element with the next item, if it's bigger - swap, if not - go to the next element and compare with element after it and so on. Than start all over from the beggining.

### Optimization of initial bubble sort
* Start from the end of the array, move to the beggining

### BigO of bubble sort

* Best: 
* Average/Worst:
