## Linked List

A linked list is an ordered collection of data elements (nodes). Each node consists of two parts: data & pointer to the next node. The data elements or nodes are linked using pointers, hence called a linked list.

### Advantages:

* It allocates memory as the list grows, compared to arrays, which have a fixed size in sone languages.

* In contrast to an array, which stores data contiguously in memory, a linked list can easily insert or remove nodes from the list without reorganization of the entire data structure.

### Disadvantages

* Random access of nodes is not allowed. Nodes must be accessed sequentially starting from the first one. Therefore, search operation is slow on a linked list.

* It uses more memory than arrays because of the storage used by their pointers.

### Types of LL

* **Singly.** A singly linked list is collection of nodes where each node has 2 parts: data and a pointer to the next node. The list terminates with a node pointing at null. Main operations on a linked list are: insert and delete.

* **Doubly**

* **Circular**
