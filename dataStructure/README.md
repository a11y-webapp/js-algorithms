<h2>Linked List</h2>

<div>
A linked list is an ordered collection of data elements(nodes). Each node consists of two parts: data & pointer to the next node. The data elements or nodes are linked using pointers, hence called a linked list.
</div>

<h4>Advantages:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>It allocates memory as the list grows. Unlike arrays, which have a fixed size. This is one the key advantages of using a linked list over an array.</li>
    <li>In contrast to an array, which stores data contiguously in memory, a linked list can easily insert or remove nodes from the list without reorganization of the entire data structure.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Random access of nodes is not allowed. Nodes must be accessed sequentially starting from the first one. Therefore, search operation is slow on a linked list.</li>
    <li>It uses more memory than arrays because of the storage used by their pointers.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Types of LL</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Singly. A singly linked list is collection of nodes where each node has 2 parts: data and a pointer to the next node. The list terminates with a node pointing at null. Main operations on a linked list are: insert and delete.</li>
    <li>Doubly</li>
    <li>Circular</li>
</ul>
